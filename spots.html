  <h2>Types of Surf Breaks</h2>
    <p>There are three main types of surf breaks: beach breaks, point breaks, and reef breaks. Each type of break has its own unique characteristics and challenges.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Beach Breaks:</strong> These breaks occur over sandy bottoms and are generally the most forgiving for beginners. The waves can be less predictable, but they are usually smaller and easier to manage.</li>
      <li><strong>Point Breaks:</strong> These breaks occur when waves hit a point of land or rocks jutting out into the ocean. They often produce longer, more consistent waves that are great for intermediate and advanced surfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Reef Breaks:</strong> These breaks occur over coral reefs or rocky seabeds. They can produce powerful, hollow waves that are best suited for experienced surfers due to the potential hazards of the reef.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choosing a Surf Spot</h2>
    <p>When choosing a surf spot, consider the following factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Skill Level:</strong> Choose a spot that matches your skill level. Beginners should look for beach breaks with smaller waves, while more experienced surfers can explore point and reef breaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Wave Conditions:</strong> Check the surf report for wave height, swell direction, and tide information. This will help you find the best conditions for surfing.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Rules and Etiquette:</strong> Be aware of any local rules or etiquette at the surf spot. Respect other surfers and the environment to ensure a positive experience for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
